# Slug-World-Cup
This is a repository to showcase the majority of the code used for my robot in the UCSC Slug World Cup robotics competition.

### What does majority mean?
Many copyrighted drivers and templates were provided by staff and, thus, cannot be shown within the repository.

### What is shown?
The code in this repository consists of state machines, event checking libraries, and code for general behavioral control of the robot.
